# Wine-prediction:Kaggle-competition

This competition competition was organised after our bootcamp class. The objective of the project is predict the prices of wine with a given features in the dataset. Here is the [link](https://www.kaggle.com/c/ammi-bootcamp-kaggle-competition/data) to the dataset to the competition. 

- The performance metric used in this competition is root mean squared error also known as RMSE. 

- In order to address this problem, we first consider the features in the dataset and perform feature exploration analysis. 

- We implemented some preprocess techniques and feature engineering on the selected features. 

- Finally build a model using deep neural network with tensorflow. 

- The jupyter notebook gives more detail to the work done.
